In Kedro, each node output must have a unique name across the entire project, even if the same node used in different pipelines. If you want to avoid using different names or prefixes for each output, you can consider using a modular pipeline approach with Kedro, where you define your node process as a separate pipeline and then reference it in both Pipeline A and Pipeline B. This way, the data preparation step is only executed once, and its outputs are reused in both pipelines.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Create a Data Preparation Pipeline**: Define a separate pipeline for the data preparation step.

2. **Use the Data Preparation Pipeline in Other Pipelines**: Reference the data preparation pipeline in both Pipeline A and Pipeline B.

Here's how you can implement this:

#### Step 1: Define the Data Preparation Pipeline

Create a new pipeline for data preparation, say `data_preparation_pipeline.py`:

```python
from kedro.pipeline import Pipeline, node
from .nodes import prepare_data_node

def create_pipeline(**kwargs) -> Pipeline:
    return Pipeline(
        [
            prepare_data_node,
        ]
    )
```

#### Step 2: Reference the Data Preparation Pipeline in Other Pipelines

In your main pipeline files, import and use the data preparation pipeline. Here's an example for Pipeline A and Pipeline B:

**Pipeline A**:

```python
from kedro.pipeline import Pipeline, pipeline
from your_project.pipelines.data_preparation_pipeline import create_pipeline as create_data_preparation_pipeline

def create_pipeline(**kwargs) -> Pipeline:
    data_preparation = create_data_preparation_pipeline()
    # Define other nodes for Pipeline A
    other_pipeline_a_nodes = Pipeline([
        # Other nodes here
    ])
    return pipeline([data_preparation, other_pipeline_a_nodes])
```

**Pipeline B**:

```python
from kedro.pipeline import Pipeline, pipeline
from your_project.pipelines.data_preparation_pipeline import create_pipeline as create_data_preparation_pipeline

def create_pipeline(**kwargs) -> Pipeline:
    data_preparation = create_data_preparation_pipeline()
    # Define other nodes for Pipeline B
    other_pipeline_b_nodes = Pipeline([
        # Other nodes here
    ])
    return pipeline([data_preparation, other_pipeline_b_nodes])
```

### Explanation

- **Modular Pipelines**: By creating a separate data preparation pipeline, you ensure that the data preparation step is only defined once and can be reused across multiple pipelines without naming conflicts.

- **Pipeline Composition**: Use the `pipeline()` function to compose pipelines, allowing you to include the data preparation pipeline in both Pipeline A and Pipeline B.

- **Reusability**: This approach makes your pipelines more modular and reusable, adhering to best practices in pipeline design.

This solution should help you avoid naming conflicts while maintaining a clean and modular project structure.
